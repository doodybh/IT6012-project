        <p class="story-text">
            This project marks an important milestone in our journey through the IT6012 course.
            Working as a team of four, we collaborated to design and build a fully functional healthcare-themed website that demonstrates our skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
            Throughout the development process, we frequently met and coordinated our work through Discord, which helped us stay organized and maintain smooth communication.
            The purpose of this page is to reflect on our experience, highlight the challenges we encountered, and share what we learned along the way.

            <h5 class="role-heading"><b>Role: Website Structure and Layout</b></h5>
            <p>I focused on developing the initial layout and overall website structure, ensuring the navigation system was clear and user-friendly. My primary goal was to build a strong foundation for the rest of the team to expand upon.</p>

            <h5 class="challenge-heading"><b>Main Challenge: File Organization</b></h5>
            <p>My biggest challenge was organizing the project files in a scalable and maintainable way. I initially struggled to keep folders neat as new components were constantly added.</p>

            <h5 class="solution-heading"><b>Lesson Learned: Consistency and Scalability</b></h5>
            <p>To overcome this, I created a standardized directory structure for storing HTML, CSS, images, and scripts. This greatly improved workflow and reduced team confusion. I learned the essential importance of consistency and file organization in collaborative development, and gained experience applying Bootstrap for responsive design.</p>

            <h5 class="role-heading"><b>Role: Functionality and Interaction</b></h5>
            <p>My role centered on enhancing page functionality and ensuring the user interface felt modern and intuitive. I worked on integrating interactive features across the site.</p>

            <h5 class="challenge-heading"><b>Main Challenge: Responsive Integration</b></h5>
            <p>I faced challenges when integrating interactive features without breaking the existing layout. Components were sometimes overlapping or misaligned, particularly when switching between mobile and desktop views.</p>

            <h5 class="solution-heading"><b>Lesson Learned: Rigorous Testing and Grid System</b></h5>
            <p>I resolved this by thoroughly reviewing the Bootstrap grid system and refining CSS rules to avoid conflicts. This taught me the importance of rigorous testing across different browsers and screen sizes. The debugging process strengthened my understanding of how front-end elements behave in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <h5 class="role-heading"><b>Role: Content Development and Visual Styling</b></h5>
            <p>My contribution focused on developing the content and visual styling of the website. I was responsible for designing a clean, cohesive layout that adhered to accessibility and readability guidelines.</p>

            <h5 class="challenge-heading"><b>Main Challenge: Balancing Aesthetics</b></h5>
            <p>The challenge was balancing aesthetics with functionality. I had to adjust text sizes, contrast ratios, and spacing multiple times. Choosing a color scheme that matched the healthcare theme without overwhelming the user interface was a specific hurdle.</p>

            <h5 class="solution-heading"><b>Lesson Learned: CSS and Bootstrap Synergy</b></h5>
            <p>Through iterations, I learned how to effectively achieve this balance. This project helped me understand the synergy between CSS and Bootstrap: Bootstrap for structure and responsiveness, and custom CSS for unique branding and personality.</p>

            <h5 class="role-heading"><b>Role: Quality Assurance and Debugging</b></h5>
            <p>My role involved testing different portions of the website, correcting errors, and ensuring that all pages worked together seamlessly as a stable and reliable platform.</p>

            <h5 class="challenge-heading"><b>Main Challenge: Cross-Page Inconsistencies</b></h5>
            <p>A major challenge was fixing inconsistencies between pages, often caused by conflicting CSS rules or minor syntax errors. Features that worked on one page sometimes failed on another due to small oversights.</p>

            <h5 class="solution-heading"><b>Lesson Learned: Attention to Detail</b></h5>
            <p>I addressed this by conducting a systematic review of each file, validating the code, and documenting every fix. I learned the critical importance of attention to detail—that a small missing tag or bracket can break an entire page. This significantly improved my debugging skills and reinforced the value of coordinated teamwork.</p>
